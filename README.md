# Project_SC
This repository contains my project for the course of Single Cell and Spatial Omics held by Prof. Tebaldi @ University of Trento (A.Y. 2023-2024).

Given an unknown dataset, the aim was to apply the standard workflow for single cell expression data and infer the cell types and the tissue of the sample.

The code of the project is available in the `cs5_unknown.Rmd` file.
